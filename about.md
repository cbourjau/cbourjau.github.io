This blog is primarily intended as a selection of things which I find useful or interesting for my work at [ALICE](http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html) at [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/). But who knows, maybe I will also post some non-work related stuff or nothing at all. Feel free to contact me at the email below.
